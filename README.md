# 🗳️ Electronic Voting System (C)


📌 Project Overview

This project is an Electronic Voting System developed in C as a personal development project, designed to simulate a complete electoral process — from voter and candidate registration to vote casting and final result reporting. The system is built using Abstract Data Types (ADT) and core Data Structures, with a strong focus on correctness, modularity, and safe memory management.




🎯 Project Goals

-Simulate a realistic electronic voting workflow

-Strengthen practical knowledge of data structures in C

-Apply modular programming using ADTs

-Improve pointer handling and dynamic memory management

-Develop a structured and maintainable C project




🧱 Data Structures Used

-Singly Linked Lists – voter management

-Doubly Linked Lists – candidate management

-Queues – organization of voters into multiple voting lines

-Stacks – storage of votes in the electronic ballot box (urna)




⚙️ System Features

-Voter registration and management

-Candidate registration using doubly linked lists

-Automatic distribution of voters into three voting queues

-Voting process with date and time recording

-Voter withdrawal from queues

-Final vote counting and result generation

-Clear separation of responsibilities through ADTs




🛡️ Memory Management

-Dynamic memory allocation is handled carefully throughout the system

-Nodes are properly freed after removal from data structures

-No shared ownership of nodes between different structures

-Defensive checks are used to avoid invalid memory access

-This ensures system stability and robustness.

This ensures system stability and robustness.
